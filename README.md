# Dimension-N

## About

Dimension-N is a proof-of-concept strategy for packaging, distributing & hosting multiplayer web games as npm packages.

"[Alpha](https://github.com/psema4/dn-game-alpha)" is currently the only available game module for Dimension-N; while not a "playable" demo, it does demonstrate how to interface with the Dimension-N server and integrate with the auto-generated game website.

Dimension-N is inspired in-part by [Pine](https://github.com/psema4/pine), and is a Node Knockout 2016 entry.
